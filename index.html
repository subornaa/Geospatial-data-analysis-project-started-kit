  <h2 id="analyzing-topographic-trends-in-forest-cutblocks-across-british-columbia">Analyzing Topographic Trends in
    Forest Cutblocks across British Columbia</h2>
  <p class="center">
    <img src="images/dem.png" alt="DEM image" width="40%">
  </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    The province of British Columbia (BC) has a wide range of forest conditions, with many different species and forest
    types. This ecological variability is in large part due to the topographic diversity across BC, with many
    mountainous regions, deep river valleys, and alpine areas. Consequently, a large amount of the harvested forest
    areas in BC are located on steep slopes.
  </p>

  <p>
    A loss of forest cover on a steep slope can result in soil instability, since roots are no longer anchoring the
    soil.
    Under the correct circumstances, this instability can result in landslides, which can damage infrastructure and in
    some cases be fatal.
    A recent study by Hancock and Wlodarczyk2025) examined the effect of the 2021 atmospheric river that occurred in BC
    on the frequency of geohazards (e.g., landslides, erosion, etc.) in harvested areas.
    The study found that geohazards occurred more frequently in cutblocks. Here we define a "cutblock" using the <a
      href="https://www.bcfpb.ca/">BC Forest Practices Board</a> definition as "[a] specific area of land with defined
    boundaries, authorized for harvest".
  </p>

  <p>
    Cutblocks, specifically clearcuts, can also result in increased risk of flooding since forest cover helps mediates
    the flow of water through the landscape. For example, a recent study by UBC Forestry professor Dr. Younes Alila and
    other researchers found that flooding is 18 times more likely in clear cut harvested areas (Pham et al., 2025).
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    The <a
      href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/forests">BC
      Ministry of Forests</a> has requested your consulting company to perform a historic analysis of the range of
    topographic conditions found across cutblocks in the province. This preliminary study aims to shed light on what
    kind of topographic conditions have experienced harvesting, and lead to future work that incorporates geohazard and
    flooding data. Your company has been asked specifically to analyze trends regarding slope and aspect, as these are
    both noted as key variables based on recent research. The Ministry also requests that the analysis consult the
    relevant existing literature to incorporate other potentially useful topographic indicators for assessing to
    geohazard and flood risk in cutblocks. Finally, the Ministry has requested the analysis be limited to an area of
    interest (AOI) in central BC as this is a preliminary study.

  <h2 id="investigating-species-at-risk-observations-within-canadian-national-parks">Investigating Species at Risk
    Observations Within Canadian National Parks</h2>
  <p class="center">
    <img src="images/parks.png" alt="SAR image" width="40%">
  </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    One of the primary purposes of parks is to protect species from negative anthropogenic influences such as
    development and natural resource extraction. Parks are especially critical for species at risk (SAR) that may have
    specific habitat requirements. In Canada, SAR are defined legally under the <em>Species at Risk Act</em> (SARA) and
    are hosted on a publicly available registry (Canada, 2018).
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent research has demonstrated how participatory monitoring datasets such as eBird and iNaturalist can help inform
    protected area management at the global scale (Mandeville et al., 2023). Specifically, these data can be used to
    assess the presence of SAR within protected areas (Cordier et al., 2025).
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/">Parks Canada</a> has contacted your consulting company with a contract job to
    analyze the occurrence of SAR within Canadian National Parks. The Agency is interested in understanding the
    occurrence of SAR across National Parks to better understand the conservation value of the parks and identify
    species that may have underrepresented habitat provided by existing parks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parks Canada (hereby the Agency) has requested your company make use of the <a href=https://www.gbif.org>Global
      Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)<a>, which combines global biodiversity datasets including citizen science
        data from eBird and iNaturalist in addition to observations from the scientific community such as fossil
        records. Parks Canada has requested the analysis be performed using the <a
          href="https://github.com/gbif/pygbif">GBIF Python Package</a> (pygbif). Ultimately, the goal of the Agency is
        to develop a dashboard website that summarizes SAR occurrences across all National parks that can be updated via
        the GBIF database.

  <h2 id="mapping-tree-species-across-the-petawawa-research-forest-using-lidar">Mapping Tree Species Across the Petawawa
    Research Forest using LiDAR</h2>

  <p class="center">
    <img src="images/prf.png" alt="PRF image" width="70%">
  </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Information about dominant tree species in a given forest stand is critical for effective forest management. Tree
    species vary in commercial, ecological, and cultural values, making them key for developing management goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tree species can be modeled across the landscape using remote sensing since trees have distinct spectral signatures
    as a result of their unique photosynthetic pigments and leaf traits. However, modelling species with LiDAR data at a
    finer spatial scale can be more challenging since most LiDAR data only captures a single wavelength (typically near
    infrared, but can be different depending on the sensor).
  </p>
  <p>
    Research has used conventional LiDAR to model tree dominant tree species in various forest ecosystems. For example,
    Räty et al. (2016) used ALS data in Finland to model dominant tree species with the downstream goal of enhancing
    timber volume estimation accuracy. Similarly, a study in the Quebec boreal forest found that five dominant tree
    species have distinct LiDAR vertical distributions that can be used to distinguish between species (Racine et al.,
    2021).
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-natural-resources">Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources</a>
    (hereby the Ministry) is interested in making us of recently acquired airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to develop
    an enhanced forest inventory (EFI). An EFI is a new iteration of forest inventory that replaces historic sample plot
    and air photo interpretation with remote sensing based modelling to derive more accurate forest attribute estimates
    (White et al., 2016). One key attribute of an EFI is dominant species. The Ministry has contracted your consulting
    company to develop an ALS model that predicts dominant tree species using an area-based approach. The Ministry has
    requested that you use the Petawawa Research Forest (PRF) as a case study. This will ultimately be used to
    contribute to the province wide EFI. As a secondary item, the Ministry is also interested whether ALS is sufficient
    on its own to model species accurately, or whether multispectral data is required in addition to ALS to be used
    within a data fusion framework.
